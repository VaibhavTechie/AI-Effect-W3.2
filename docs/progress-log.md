# Progress Log – WP3.2 Orchestrator

## Stage 1: Configuration Parser Test

- Created a test script `test_config_parser.py` in `src/orchestrator/`:

  ```python
  from config_parser import parse_config

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      config = parse_config("/config/energy-pipeline.json")
      print("Config loaded successfully:")
      print(config)
  ```

- Mounted `config/energy-pipeline.json` inside the container at `/config/energy-pipeline.json`.

- Ran the test script inside the container:

  ```bash
  docker-compose run --rm orchestrator /bin/sh
  python test_config_parser.py
  ```

- Output:

  ```
  gun@Legion:~/ai-effect-wp3.2-orchestrator/docker$ docker-compose run --rm orchestrator /bin/sh
  WARN[0000] /home/gun/ai-effect-wp3.2-orchestrator/docker/docker-compose.yml: the attribute `version` is obsolete, it will be ignored, please remove it to avoid potential confusion
  # python test_config_parser.py
  Config loaded successfully:
  {'workflow_name': 'energy_data_pipeline', 'containers': [{'id': 'energy-generator', 'name': 'Energy Data Generator', 'command': 'docker run energy-generator', 'input_file': 'energy_data.csv', 'output_file': 'output1.json', 'depends_on': []}, {'id': 'energy-analyzer', 'name': 'Energy Data Analyzer', 'command': 'docker run energy-analyzer', 'input_file': 'output1.json', 'output_file': 'output2.json', 'depends_on': ['energy-generator']}, {'id': 'report-generator', 'name': 'Report Generator', 'command': 'docker run report-generator', 'input_file': 'output2.json', 'output_file': 'energy_report.csv', 'depends_on': ['energy-analyzer']}]}
  ```

- Result:
  - Config file parsed successfully
  - Volumes and config file mounted correctly
  - Parser ready to integrate into orchestrator

---

## Stage 2: Execution Engine Test

- Implemented `execute_workflow()` in `executor.py` to execute Docker commands from the workflow config.
- Updated `main.py` to load config and call the executor.
- Ran the main orchestrator entry:

  ```bash
  docker-compose run --rm orchestrator python main.py
  ```

- Output:

  ```
  WARN[0000] /home/gun/ai-effect-wp3.2-orchestrator/docker/docker-compose.yml: the attribute `version` is obsolete, it will be ignored, please remove it to avoid potential confusion
  Running: docker run energy-generator
  Unable to find image 'energy-generator:latest' locally
  docker: Error response from daemon: pull access denied for energy-generator, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'.
  See 'docker run --help'.
  Error: Command failed: docker run energy-generator
  ```

- Result:
  - Commands read and executed in defined order
  - Waits for each container to finish
  - Basic error handling in place (invalid image names, etc.)

---

## Stage 3: Integration with WP3.1 Pipeline

- Cloned the WP3.1 repo:  
  `https://github.com/AvantiRao/AIEffect-3.1-to-3.2.git`

- Fixes performed:
  - Corrected volume mount paths in `docker-compose.yaml`
  - Fixed Dockerfile `COPY` path errors and typos (e.g., `CCOPY`)
  - Updated code in containers to use absolute paths (e.g., `/data/output1.json`) instead of relative

- Created `energy_data.csv` manually to simulate input (since W3.1 had not supplied it)
- All output files were stored in the `data/` folder:
  - `energy_data.csv`
  - `output1.json`, `output2.json`
  - `energy_report.csv`

---

## Successful Pipeline Execution

- Ran full pipeline with:

  ```bash
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up --build
  ```

- Results:
  -  `energy-generator`: generated 3 records
  -  `energy-analyzer`: analyzed and annotated records
  -  `report-generator`: generated `energy_report.csv`
  - All containers exited with code `0`

---

## Next Steps

- Replace `docker run` with `docker-compose run` for more isolated workflow testing
- Add execution logs (stdout) to file or orchestrator log
- Begin integration with WP3.2 orchestrator for dynamic execution in Iteration 2

# WP3.2 Orchestrator – Stage 3 Run Documentation

## Summary
This document records the execution of the full energy pipeline orchestration using the WP3.1 Docker-based microservices and WP3.2 orchestrator.

---

## Stage 3 – Orchestrated Pipeline Execution

### Setup Steps
1. Copied the generated `energy_data.csv` file into the shared `data/` directory.
2. Ensured Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.
3. Inside the project root (`AIEffect-3.1-to-3.2`), executed:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up --build
   ```

---

### Component Execution Logs

#### 1. **Energy Generator**
- Successfully generated 10 rows of mock household energy usage data.
- Output saved to: `data/energy_data.csv`
- Sample Entry:
  ```csv
  timestamp,household_id,power_consumption,voltage,current
  2024-01-15T10:30:00Z,H003,2.04,230.12,8.5
  ```

#### 2. **Energy Analyzer**
- Read `energy_data.csv`, calculated efficiency, flagged anomalies.
- Output saved to: `data/output1.json`
- Sample JSON Entry:
  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "household_id": "H003",
    "power": 2.04,
    "efficiency": 0.135,
    "status": "normal",
    "anomaly_detected": false
  }
  ```
- All 10 records processed with no invalid rows.

#### 3. **Report Generator**
- Took the analyzed JSON and created a final report.
- Output saved to: `data/energy_report.csv`

---

## Issues Encountered
- Initial Docker builds failed due to incorrect Dockerfile paths.
- Needed to generate test CSV manually for the pipeline to consume.
- Resolved permission errors while writing to `data/`.
- Fixed a typo (`CCOPY`) in Dockerfile which broke image build.

---

## Outcome
The pipeline executed successfully end-to-end:
- 10 records flowed through 3 containers.
- Every output file was generated as intended.
- Each container ran independently and exited cleanly.

---

## Files in `/data` after execution
- `energy_data.csv`
- `output1.json`
- `output2.json`
- `energy_report.csv`

---

## Next Steps
- Add additional validation logic or exception handling in orchestrator.
- Automate data generation or allow config-based batch runs.
- Move on to Iteration 2 as described in mentor docs.

---

## Stage 3 – Orchestrator Triggering External Containers

### Objective:
To verify that the WP3.2 orchestrator can execute and control the WP3.1 containerized services using a JSON-driven workflow.

### Key Fixes Implemented:
- Manually updated `energy-pipeline.json` to include absolute volume mounts:
  ```json
  "command": "docker run -v /home/work/project/AIEffect-3.1-to-3.2/data:/data aieffect-31-to-32-energy-generator"
  ```
  - Applied same fix for analyzer and report-generator containers.
- Verified output file generation by running each container manually:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -v "$PWD/data:/data" aieffect-31-to-32-energy-analyzer
  docker run --rm -v "$PWD/data:/data" aieffect-31-to-32-report-generator
  ```

### Final Run from WP3.2 Orchestrator:
- From `AI-Effect-W3.2/docker/`, executed:
  ```bash
  docker-compose run --rm orchestrator python main.py
  ```
- Observed full pipeline execution:
  - Generator → Analyzer → Report
  - All outputs created correctly in `/data/`
- Output logs confirmed that all 3 containers executed in order and completed without error.

### Outcome:
- Confirmed that WP3.2 orchestrator can run WP3.1 containers using volume-mounted files.
- Pipeline completes from within WP3.2 context, even though containers belong to 3.1.
- No refactor needed inside container logic; orchestration driven via JSON `command` field.
